# Bio
I'm Peter Van Sandt. My current focused hobby project is to use Conda to package Bazel projects to improve polyglot workflows.

I like doing that as a hobby, but I wouldn't want to do it professionally.
Professionally, I make fast programs go faster.
My improvements are all around throughput, but that throughput is limited by a variety of time budgets from microseconds to minutes and by a variety of batch sizes from tiny batches to GB.
I also try to improve my ability to maximize the re-usability of that library functionality without that re-use increasing maintenance costs.

I've written programs around my interests in SIMD, GPUs, file systems and OS, interpolation search, pseudorandom number generation and sorting.

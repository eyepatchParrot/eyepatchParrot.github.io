For 8 years, from 2007 to 2014, I participated in an annual speed game
development contest. The exact format changed a little from year to year,
but the premise was largely the same. At the beginning of the contest,
a theme or a set of themes is released. Developers then have two weeks
to develop a game that fits the released theme. The games are then graded
across four different categories.

In 2007, my first year, I joined up with another, more experienced
programmer where we attempted to develop an entry using BlitzBasic. The
resulting game was barely functional, but the experience motivated me
to keep working at it.

In 2008, I decided to work alone, and I went from using a basic language
to using Torque Game Engine, which is now called Torque 2D. Since this
was my first exposure to the game engine and game engines in general, I
developed an extraordinarily simple game based around reaction time and
simple planning. The balance and gameplay, however, were well designed
enough in order to warrant a 3rd place position.

In 2009, I changed to using BlitzMax, the successor technology to
BlitzBasic. I went for an extremely ambitious strategy game, developing
all of the assets myself. The sound was hand-made in a synthesizer, the
art drawn pixel-by-pixel, and the game built up from scratch. In the
end, I am very proud of what I created and the amount of effort I put
in. However, I learned how important it is to design for your users. While
I was able to ‘get’ the game and understand what made the game fun,
I failed to design the user interaction with the game in such a way that
others could discover the same fun that I had.

In 2010, my major technology interest was in developing my own particle
engine, so that was one of the technical aspects that most excited
me. I built a relatively simple arcade style game with basic movement
controls and foes that killed by contact. The patterns of the enemies
complimented each other such that movement alone became fun and I was
able to win 2nd place.

In 2011,  I returned to Torque Game Engine to develop the sequel to the
game that I had made the year prior. I reworked some of the gameplay to
better fit the next year’s theme, but I was able to keep a lot of the
core elements. The competition that year was really tough, but I was
able to win 3rd place.

In 2012, I had been working with P1XL games as an intern, and I also
joined them for the game development competition that year. I used their
platform which is Java-based, and we were able to win 1st place.

In 2013, I broke away from P1XL games for the competition and I lead my
own team to build a tower-defense style game that won 3rd place.

2014 was the last year that I competed. I lead my own team and developed
my game using Torque Game Engine, but there were a lot of excellent
entries, and we were not able to place.

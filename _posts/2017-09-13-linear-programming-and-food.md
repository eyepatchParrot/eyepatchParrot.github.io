Since Freshman year of college, I've been interested in finding how I
can eat the healthiest diet that I can at the lowest cost. Until now,
I've relied on Google Sheets and pivot tables, but at MadHacks 2017, I
developed the beginning of an application that can do it more precisely
and easily than ever before. It uses the data that I've collected about
nutritional information, sourced from USDA, and some pricing information
that I've collected from the local area to run a linear programming
optimizer and get your cheapest, healthy diet for your needs and your
area.

Because of the time constraints, I wanted the debugging ease of a strongly
typed server, so I learned how to use Go to service the pages. In my
previous work at Jump Trading, developing a d3 application, I learned
how to use JavaScript for an interactive front-end, and I expanded that
knowledge by using Bootstrap.
